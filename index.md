# The Disco Clan

The Disco Clan is a gaming community that was originally founded in 1997, and has been active for most of that time. 
As most of our members have left their teenage years behind them and now have many adult responsibilities, we are not
quite as active as we used to be.

We still game together from time to time, but no longer on a daily basis.
