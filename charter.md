This charter describes the organisation known as the Tysan Clan, it's procedures, the roles, privileges and duties of it's members for as long as they choose to keep using this website.

# 1. Membership
The Tysan Clan is a private organisation and reserves the right to grant or deny membership to any person.

## 1.2. Becoming a member
Membership may be requested by any person, unless said person is:

   1  Under 13 years of age. Further age restrictions may be imposed by regulations
   2. A member of another online gaming organisation involved in the same games as the Tysan Clan. Exceptions may be granted by regulations on a group basis, or by the Chancellor on an individual basis
   3. A former member whose membership was terminated following a Truthsayer trial

## 1.3. Trial period
A membership request does not guarantee membership. Following a membership application, a member needs approval from at least one Senator before being granted a trial membership (in case no Senators are available to vote, a trial membership is granted by default after 3 days). A trial membership lasts at most 17 days, and will automatically convert into a normal membership unless the trial member:

   1. Does not login for a period of 7 days or longer
   2. Receives a percentage of positive approval votes (by all non-trial members) of less than 60%
   3. Is convicted by a Truthsayer

## 1.4. Termination
Furthermore, a membership may be terminated in the following situations:

   1. A member is not marked as being "retired" or "on vacation", and has not logged in for at least 14 days
   2. A member is marked as being "on vacation", but not as "retired", and has not logged in for at least 60 days
   3. A member is marked as being "retired", and has not logged in for at least 1 year
   4. A member has been found in violation of a regulation and been judged guilty by a Truthsayer, with either the member having comitted a severe infraction, or multiple minor ones. Such a violation also permanently revokes any right of membership.

# 2. Regulations
Regulations are special rules of conduct that place limitations upon the behavior and conduct of members of the Tysan Clan.

## 2.1. Introduction and amendment
A regulation can be introduced or altered in two ways:

  1. Drafted by a Senator and approved by a Senate majority vote, giving the Chancellor the right to veto unless a two-thirds majority is reached in the Senate
  2. Drafted by the Chancellor and approved by a Senate majority vote

## 2.2. Repeal
A regulation can be repealed in two ways:

   1. A majority Senate vote, giving the Chancellor the right to veto unless a two-thirds majority is reached in the Senate
   2. An untenability vote, which is initiated by a Truthsayer and requires a two-thirds majority from all non-trial members

## 2.3. Limitations
A regulation is subject to the following limitations:

   1. A regulation may not contradict this charter, or other existing regulations
   2. A regulation may not impose restrictions on the private lives of members, nor coerce them to undertake any action not related to games played by Tysan, including, but not limited to:
      1. Mandatory attendance at given times
      2. Meeting of other members in person, or if such meetings do take place voluntarily, any action at such a meeting
      3. The requirement of making monetary contributions
      4. The requirement of making in-game contributions, unless the contribution involves an in-game object or currency that was obtained as part of a group effort by a group containing at least 50% Tysan Members. Acts demanding in-game currency-based contributions are limited to 10% of the total amount obtained by a player during said effort
      5. Grant powers not granted by this charter to a given rank
   3. A regulation may not promote the use of tools or practices deemed "non-legit", with the exception of tools for channel moderation.
   4. A regulation may not promote activities that are in violation of the Terms of Use or End User License Agreements of any games played
   5. A regulation may not promote activities that are illegal in any countries inhabited by members of the Tysan Clan
   6. A regulation may not limit free speech, though it may enforce civil behavior

# 3. Ranks
Each member of the Tysan Clan is given a rank, representing either seniority or a specific function. These ranks are Chancellor, Senator, Truthsayer, Revered Member, Senior Member, Full Member, Junior Member and Trial Member. Each rank represents either a certain length of membership, or an elected position. No rank grants a member the right to give commands to other members, unless as specified in this charter or as in regulations, subject to the restrictions given in section 2.3.

## 3.1. Chancellor
The Chancellor is the executive branch of the Tysan Clan, and is therefore also it's symbolic leader.

### 3.1.1. Privileges and responsibilities
The Chancellor has the following privileges and responsibilities:

   1. The Chancellor has the right to create committees for a given task, and to select a member to lead such a committee
   2. The Chancellor must ensure the stability of the clan, and lead recruitment efforts
   3. The Chancellor has the right to assign roles for a given task or duty, and to select a person to fulfill those roles
   4. The Chancellor may select candidates for the position of Truthsayer, and present him or her before the Senate
   5. The Chancellor has the right to draft new regulations and present them before the Senate
   6. The Chancellor has the right to veto proposed, repealed and altered regulations, unless the Senate has at least 3 members, and votes in favor with a two thirds majority (counting abstentions as "against" votes)
   7. The Chancellor has the right to propose inter-clan alliances to the Senate
   8. The Chancellor has the right to approve the creation of groups (see also article 4)
   9. The Chancellor has the right to assign supervisors for games played by the clan, as well as supervisors for each realm games are played on
   10. The Chancellor has the right to veto a new achievement, in which case 66% of the full Senate must vote in favor for it pass

### 3.1.2. Election
To become a Chancellor, a member must first be nominated. A nomination can be secured if your rank is at least Full Member, and either you have donated at least $30 in the previous 6 months, or at least 5% of the total number of members endorses you. Endorsements can not be given by Trial Members. All nominated members participate in an election by Borda Count, which lasts 1 week. Each member, with the exception of Trial Members, assigns a unique score to each candidate (with the highest score being the number of candidates, and the lowest being 1). The member with the highest total score becomes the new Chancellor. Chancellor elections take place every 6 months.

### 3.1.3. End of term
A Chancellor loses his position in the following cases:

   1. The election of another member as Chancellor
   2. An impeachment procedure, which can only be initiated by a Truthsayer and requires a two-third Senate majority
   3. By voluntarily stepping down

A former Chancellor is however free to participate in elections, and can therefore be re-elected after being impeached.

## 3.2. Senator
The Senate is the legislative branch of the Tysan Clan, as well as a moderator for both the Chancellor and for Truthsayers. A member of the Senate is called a senator.

### 3.2.1. Privileges and responsibilities
A Senator has the following privileges and responsibilities:

   1. A Senator has the right to draft regulations and present them before the rest of the Senate
   2. A Senator has the right to vote on drafted regulations
   3. A Senator has the right to overrule a veto by the Chancellor, if two-thirds of the Senate agree
   4. A Senator has the right to approve Truthsayers proposed by the Chancellor, for which a two-third majority is required
   5. A Senator has the right to approve inter-clan alliances
   6. A Senator has the right to approve new achievements

### 3.2.2. Election
To become a Senator, a member must first be nominated. A nomination can be secured if your rank is at least Full Member, and either you have donated at least $20 in the previous 6 months, or at least 3% of the total number of members endorses you. Endorsements can not be given by Trial Members. Each member, with the exception of Trial Members, assigns a unique score to each candidate (with the highest score being the number of candidates, and the lowest being 1). The top N members with the highest total scores gain a seat in the Senate, where N is at least 2 of the total number of members (based on actual number of members, the formula is

    max ( 2, min ( candidates-1, (membercount / 20) + 1 ))

). Senate elections take place every 6 months.


### 3.2.3. End of term
A Senator loses his position in the following cases:

   1. Not participating in a Senate election, or not ending in the top N
   2. Being convicted of a regulation violation
   3. If the total Senate size drops to less than 40% of it's original size, in which case new elections are held
   4. By voluntarily stepping down

Note that convictions do not bar a member from participating in elections - so a convicted member can become Senator again.

A Truthsayer has the following rights and responsibilities.

   1. A Truthsayer has the right to initiate an impeachment procedure against the Chancellor
   2. A Truthsayer has the right to declare a regulation "untenable", after which a clan majority can decide to repeal the act
   3. A Truthsayer has the right to convict other members of regulation violations. Note however that a Truthsayer can not convict a member if he himself pressed the charges, but another Truthsayer can
   4. A Truthsayer has the right to moderate any public forum
   5. A Truthsayer has the duty to uphold the legit nature of the Tysan Clan as vigorously as possible
   6. A Truthsayer has the right to approve achievement requests of members
   7. A Truthsayer may block a new achievement if it uses imagery that violates regulations, upon which the submitter may submit a new image to restart the vote
   8. A Truthsayer may remove a new achievement if it violates or promotes the violation of this charter or one or more Regulations

### 3.3.2. Becoming a Truthsayer
To become a Truthsayer, a member must have at least the rank of Full Member and not currently serve as Chancellor or Senator (or participate in an election for such a position). The Chancellor can then nominate said member for the position of Truthsayer (which the member can accept or deny), after which a two-third majority of the Senate must approve the nomination. If this is approved, the member becomes a Truthsayer.

### 3.3.3. End of term
The Truthsayer position is in principle indefinite, but can be ended in several ways:

   1. By being convicted of a regulation violation. Regardless of the violation, this will result in terminated membership as Truthsayers should know better
   2. By being elected as either Senator or Chancellor
   3. By voluntarily stepping down
   4. By a 66% majority vote (with abstentions counting as no) by the Senate. This vote can only be initiated after a formal complaint has been filed by a member and approved by the Chancellor, provided the Chancellor has taken effort to resolve the conflict as a mediator between the member who filed the complaint and the Truthsayer in question.

## 3.4. Trial Members
A Trial Member is a member who has been accepted by the Senate, but has not yet been accepted by the clan as a whole.

## 3.4.1. Limitations
A Trial Member has no special responsibilities or limitations, except the following:

   1. A Trial Member's membership is terminated if he or she has not logged in for at least 7 days
   2. A Trial Member may not vote
   3. A Trial Member may not gain "vacation" or "retired" status

### 3.4.2. Becoming a Trial Member
A person can become a Trial Member by the procedure described in article 1.2.

### 3.4.3. Promotion
A person gains the rank of Junior Member if meeting the requirements stated in article 1.3.

### 3.5. Other Members
The four remaining ranks are Junior Member, Full Member, Senior Member and Revered Member. These ranks are granted automatically after a given amount of time, and grant no special privileges and have no limitations, with the exception of Full Member being the minimum rank for becoming Chancellor, Senator or Truthsayer, as described in articles 3.1.2, 3.2.2 and 3.3.2. These ranks are granted as follows:

  1. The rank of Junior Member is granted upon passing the trial vote
  2. The rank of Full Member is granted after 4 months of membership
  3. The rank of Senior Member is granted after 2 years of membership
  4. The rank of Revered Member is granted after 5 years of membership

## 4. Groups
Members of the Tysan Clan have the right to form groups. There are 3 types of groups: gaming groups, social groups and committees. A gaming group is a group dedicated to playing a certain game. A social group is a group of people sharing a common interest, and a committee is a special group created by the Chancellor for a specific clan purpose.
### 4.1. Formation
Any member with the rank Full Member or higher can request the creation of a gaming group or social group, which must be approved by the Chancellor. In addition, the Chancellor can create committees.
### 4.2. Leadership

### 4.3. Dissolution
A group is dissolved once it no longer has any members.

# 5. Positions
A position is a special role a member can have, similar to a committee, but covering a responsibility that does not require multiple persons. A position is in most cases created and assigned by the Chancellor, and can only be revoked by the Chancellor. There are a number of exceptions, however.
## 5.1 Treasurer
The Treasurer is a special position that is held by the person in charge of clan finances. The Treasurer is bound by the charter and regulations like any other member. In addition, the Treasurer has the following duties and rights:

   1. The right to receive donations, and receive income from subscriptions
   2. The duty to assign donated funds to the Steward and Herald
   3. The right to prioritize funds if there are insufficient donations and reserves to cover all costs
   4. The duty to keep these funds save. Any improper use of funds not mandated by the Charter and not mandated by the Chancellor and approved by the Senate may result in permanent banishment from the clan.
   5. The right to disband the clan if there are not enough funds to cover even the most basic essential service

When prioritizing funds, essential services have priority over non-essential services. The following services are considered essential (in order of decreasing priority):

   * (VPS) Server hosting
   * Domain name
   * SSL Certificate

The following services are considered non-essential (in order of decreasing priority):

   * Voice chat servers
   * Expenses not named in the charter, but mandated by the Chancellor and approved by a Senate majority

Should the Treasurer no longer wish to fulfill his role for whatever reason, he must choose a successor from among volunteers (approved by Senate and Chancellor), and transfer any outstanding reserves to the new Treasurer.

The current Treasurer is: **Prospero**

## 5.2 Steward
The Steward is a special position that is held by the person in charge of hosting the website. The Steward is bound by the charter and regulations like any other member. In addition, the Steward has the following duties and rights:

  2. The duty to maintain the domain name www.tysanclan.com, and ensure it points to aforementioned server
  3. The duty to provide an SSL certificate for this domain

  6. The duty to perform upgrades provided by Website Administrators in a timely manner
  7. The right to refuse upgrades that contradict the charter or threaten the security of the website
  8. The duty to perform regular backups

If possible, the former Herald must also transfer control of any voice communication servers to the new Herald.

The current Herald is: **Prospero**

## 5.4 Website Administrators
A Website Administrator is defined as any member of Tysan who can directly access the database running the website, as well as any member with write access to the source code repository. Website Administrators are subject to the following limitations and privileges:

   1. Website Administrators may create new features for this website at their own disgression, provided these features do not violate the charter or any regulations, and provided that features of broad enough scope will be submitted for Charter inclusion (with the understanding that if there is any doubt regarding the scope, it will be submitted)
   2. Website Administrators may not use their position for personal gain, revenge, or other actions that would by any reasonable moral standard be considered petty
   3. Website Administrators are allowed to correct technical problems that would constitute an unintended violation of this Charter.

# 6. Achievements
Achievements represent a predefined set of goals that can be achieved by members. Upon achieving these goals, the member in question will have a special icon added to his profile.

## 6.1 Creating achievements
Any member with a rank of at least Full Member may create a proposal for a new Achievement. To do so, he must provide a name and description (which must include detailed instructions for the conditions under which it is achieved) as well as a small icon to be displayed with the achievement

## 6.2 Approving new achievements
An achievement must be supported by a mjaority of the Senate, and may be vetoed by the Chancellor (in which case the required percentage becomes 66% of the full Senate). In addition, Truthsayers may block a proposed achievement if it has an icon that violates Tysan Regulations. A blocked proposal may be unblocked by submitting a new image, upon which the vote restarts. If the achievement violates or promotes the violation of the Charter or one or more Regulation, a Truthsayer may remove the request completely.

## 6.3 Granting achievements to members
To get an achievement displayed in an appropriate location associated with that member, a request must be submitted by the member who has met the requirements. Evidence in the form of a URL or a screenshot must be supplied. A Truthsayer can then choose to grant or decline the request. Evidence that is not authentic and/or falsified in any way or form will be punished as per regulations.

# 7. Changing the Charter
A Charter change may be requested by any member with the rank Chancellor, Senator or Truthsayer, or by any member who holds any of the Herald, Steward or Treasurer roles regardless of rank.

   1. A Charter change must be sponsored by a Website Administrator as defined by section 5.4, and determined to be feasible by said Website Administrator.
   2. A Charter change may only be requested if a clear problem exists for which a charter change can provide an effective solution
   3. A Charter change must be approved by the Chancellor, the full Senate and all Truthsayers. Those that abstain from voting count as voting Yes.
   4. If a Charter change directly affects any regular role as mentioned in section 5, the person holding that role must also approve
   5. If full approval is reached within 1 week, the sponsoring Website Administrator will process the Charter Change and any other changes required to make them work. The Charter change does not come into effect until all necessary changes are made and uploaded
   6. Any person who does not approve of a Charter Change must provide an alternative to the stated problem, unless a majority of those eligible to vote is against the charter change.

# 8. Closing
This charter describes the procedures and basic rules for the organization of the Tysan Clan. It provides a framework for regulations and denotes the limitations of those in power. This document is not however meant to be a legal document in any nation, state or other sovereign entity or part thereof. Also, it is merely valid for as long as a majority of the Tysan Clan acknowledges it.
