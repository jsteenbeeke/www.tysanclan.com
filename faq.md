# Frequently asked questions

On this page you can find answers to questions that get asked a lot.

## Who started all this?

We don't know his real name, though his Battle.net alias was **(TYC)Blayde**, and he allegedly created Tysan in December 1997.
None of our existing members have ever met him, and he has become something of a mythical person. A far less mythical founding figure was **Tadrith**, who some of
our existing members have actually gamed with.

Tysan in its current form is the result of years of evolution and reorganization.

## There's no way your clan is that old

That's not a question.

#### Okay, okay, were you really founded in 1997?

The honest answer is we're not entirely sure, though we do use December 1997 as the basis for anniversaries. Our site has mentioned
1997 as our founding year since at least 2000, though it also mentioned 1999 as the date Tysan was "refounded". We have
confirmed that Tysan was active in 1999 through old posts by members on the Battle.net Clan Hall forum, and those members
 were still there when **Prospero** joined in 2001 (and he's still here).
 
We've had two people visit our forums who claimed to have been part of Tysan in 1997 or 1998.
 
On the other hand, our friends from the Defenders of Camelot (who are definitely older than us) are adamant that Tysan
did not exist prior to 1999.

Either way, we've been here over twenty years.

## How do I join?

Head on over to our Discord and ask us. We don't really have a formal process these days, so please give us an excuse
to figure out a process for this.

### Hey, I used to have rank X back in the day, can I get it back?

No. Besides, we more or less abolished our ranking system a few years ago.

#### More or less?

**LordInfiniti** is still our Truthsayer, and **Prospero** hosts the website and runs the Discord server and Minecraft server.

## Who designed this site?

Originally **Prospero**, though he's not a web designer and one of his mottos is "for the love of God don't let me design user interfaces". After he got bored by the Minecraft design he had CoPilot vibe-code a different design.

#### Would he be interested in an updated design?

Certainly! Feel free to suggest it on Discord.

## What happened to your old site?

It was archived in favor of this one. We were barely using the old site, and could no longer justify the expenses of keeping it up. Prospero does still have a project hidden somewhere for a more interactive and modern site but he rarely works on it, and frankly there's no need for it currently.
