# Frequently asked questions

On this page you can find answers to questions that get asked a lot.

## Who started all this?

We don't know his real name, though his Battle.net alias was **Tony B.**, and he allegedly created Disco in December 1977.
None of our existing members have ever met him, and he has become something of a mythical person. A far less mythical founding figure was **Bobby T.**, who some of
our existing members have actually gamed with.

Disco in its current form is the result of years of evolution and reorganization.

## There's no way your clan is that old

That's not a question.

#### Okay, okay, were you really founded in 1977?

No man, way earlier. Disco was always there.

## How do I join?

We'll let you know when we figure out a new process for this site.

### Hey, I used to have rank X back in the day, can I get it back?

No. Besides, we more or less abolished our ranking system

## Who designed this site?

That would be **Bobby P.**.

#### Would he be interested in an updated design?

Certainly! Feel free to suggest it on Discord.

## What happened to your old site?

It was archived in favor of this one. We were barely using the old site, and could no longer justify the expenses of keeping it up.
Should we experience unexpected growth and need it again, we can always relaunch it.

## What's with the disco theme?

Check the date.
