title: Guiding principles
---

We have always played a wide variety of games, and creating a general set of rules that covers the many facets of all these different games is a daunting task. Instead, we have chosen to create a set of guiding principles that form the basis for communication, and as a starting point for game-specific rules.

- We strive to create a **level playing field**, and to avoid **unfair advantages**
- We **remain friendly with one another**
- We respect the **property** of and **effort done** by our fellow members
- We take responsibility for **our actions** and for **our guests**
- When a game allows **PVP**, this will only be done in a **consensual manner**
- Communication will be kept **family friendly** and will **avoid slang**
- We will always respect other communities, and never drag The Tysan Clan into a personal conflict
