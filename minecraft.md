Prospero runs a _mostly Vanilla_ Minecraft Java Edition server at the following location:

```
ellcrys.dyndns.org
```

As of writing this, it is running version `1.21.11`. It is a Fabric server with a bunch of mods, a few datapacks, and a custom resourcepack.

## Connecting with Vanilla Minecraft

The server has a whitelist, so you need to be added. Aside from that, you can connect with an unmodded Minecraft client, though you'll miss a few interesting features such as:

- Voice chat
- Custom audio
- The ability to change the pose of armor stands

## Setting up Fabric

If you want to have the full experience, you'll need to install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). You can download the [universal installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and it will handle the rest. After this, you can download mods and place them in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. For instructions on finding this folder on your system, please refer to [this article](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/.minecraft#Locating_.minecraft). 

### Mods

Prospero runs the following mods client-side:

## Seed

The current world seed is `The Return of Chicken Jesus`, which is a reference to something that happened during an Ultra Hardcore session where we tried to defeat the Ender Dragon.

We do not currently have a world map, but you can explore the biomes and generated features for this seed at ChunkBase:

| Dimension  | Map                                                                                                                                     |
